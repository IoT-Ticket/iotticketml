# IoT-Ticket Machine Learning Learning Library for Python: iotticketml

IoT-Ticket Machine Learning library contains machine learning implementations
developed by IoT-Ticket experts. At the moment the library contains `cluster`
package which has 2 correlation clustering algorithms for clustering
high-dimensional data:

* **CHUNX** - Clustering Hierarchical correlations of cUrve shapes uNtil clusters satisfy maXimum size criterion
* **CRUSHES** - CoRrelation clUStering based on Hierarchical mutual correlation Estimation of curve Shapes


## Getting started
1. Clone the reporsitory to `<your-path>`
2. Append `PYTHONPATH` with `<your-path>`:
```py
import sys
sys.path.append('<your-path>')
```
3. Start using library packages in your application
```py
import iotticketml.cluster as IC
```
